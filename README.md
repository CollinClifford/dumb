# Project I was tooling around with for React practice.

This is something I was developing on the side to practice my abilities to create React apps.

This project displays my ability to:
 * useState to store variables within the React app.
 * write proper JSX.
 * write multiple components that pass props.
 * use conditional rendering to display parts of the website.
